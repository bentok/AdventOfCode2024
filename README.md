# Advent of Code 2024 🎄✨

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repo! This year, I’m taking a creative twist: solving puzzles in Godot while crafting a little game vignette along the way. 🎮

## 🎯 Goals

1. Solve each daily puzzle in GDScript using Godot's scripting capabilities.
2. Build a festive game vignette by the end of Advent, incorporating:
    * Animated elements.
    * Interactivity
3. Use this project as an opportunity to:
    * Explore STEM concepts with my daughter.
    * Collaborate on pixel art assets she creates. 🎨
    * Introduce her to coding through Godot.

## 👩‍💻 Why Godot?

In past years, I’ve tackled Advent of Code puzzles in F#, but this time I wanted:

* A visual, interactive medium to make it a little more interesting
* A chance to deepen my skills in game development.
* A fun way to share coding with my daughter.

## 🎄 How It Works

Each day's puzzle will be implemented as a script inside the Godot project.
The game will gradually grow, and as time permits generate the solutions by interacting with the game.

## 👾 Attribution
